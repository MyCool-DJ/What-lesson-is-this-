# ðŸ‘‰ Day 12 Challenge

ðŸ‘‰ Try and fix this code which is *full* of errors.

*First, delete any other code in your `main.py` file. Copy each code snippet below into `main.py` by clicking the copy icon in the top right of each code box. Then, hit `run` and see what errors occur. Fix the errors and press `run` again until you are error free. Click on the `ðŸ‘€ Answer` to compare your code to the correct code.*


```python
print("100 Days of Code QUIZ")
print()
print("How many can you answer correctly?)
ans1 = ("What language are we writing in?")
if ans1 == "python":
  print("Correct")
else:
  print("NopeðŸ™ˆ
ans2 = input("Which lesson number is this?")
if(ans2>12):
print("We're not quite that far yet")
else:
  print("We've gone well past that!")
elif(ans2==12):
  print("That's right!")
  ```
